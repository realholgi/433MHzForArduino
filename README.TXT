433MHz radio libraries for Arduino

This package contains three libraries for use with Arduino:

 - RemoteSensor: send and receive data of a weather station with remote sensors.
 - RemoteSwitch: send and receive data of radio controlled power switches.
 - InterruptChain: chains Arduino interrupts; allows for receiving both sensor
   and switch controls at the same time.
   
The libraries are well documented with helpful examples to get you started.
